        summary: "Learn what high blood pressure is, why it matters, and how to manage it through lifestyle changes and medication.",
        content: "High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common condition where the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke. It's important to have it checked regularly.",
